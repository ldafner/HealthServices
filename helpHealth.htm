        <h1>Online Help:</h1>
	    <p>The <b>My Health Services</b> application helps residents discover health facilities that exist in their community and obtain information about them. My Health Facilities is a single application that can be deployed by state government health organizations and used by citizens on a desktop PC, mobile phone, and tablet device.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The My Health Services application offers a simple way for residents to locate healthcare facilities and information about services provided within their community. To locate an area of interest, simply enter an address in the search box, or use your current location. Your location will then be highlighted on the map and relevant facility information will be presented to the user.  </p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are three primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a address when you've located it. You can also use your current location or finally search for an address to find hazards and facilities.</p>
        <h4><u>Map Based Navigation</u></h4>
        <p>There are several ways to interact with the map:<br /><br />1. Use the basemap switcher to select the basemap you'd like to interact with<br />2. Hold down the shift key and drag a box on the map to zoom in<br />3. Hold Down Ctrl+Shift to zoom out<br />4. Roll your mouse roller to zoom in/out<br />5. Drag the zoom slider to zoom in/out</p>
        <h4><u>Searching</u></h4>
        <p>The search box can be used to find an address:<br /><br />1. Enter the address you're interested in<br />2. Click on the item in the list to locate the address on the map</p>
        <h4><u>Facility Information</u></h4>
        <p>After searching for a respective address, relevant facility information will be presented in the bottom of the application. In addition, you'll also find a list of the closest facilities and directions to each.<br /></p>
        <h4><u>Directions</u></h4>
        <p>You can also get directions to each facility using your current location or an address you select. When you find a  facility you'd like to visit, click the Direction button, to calculate the directions and route.</p>
        <h4><u>Share Your Map</u></h4>
        <p>You can click on the Share Map button to share your map several different ways.  You can compose an email, post to your Facebook wall or post a Tweet. When you use the Facebook or Twitter links, you'll be asked to sign in to your respective account.</p>
        <h4><u>More Information</u></h4>
        <p>The <b>My Health Services</b> application can used by public health departments to deliver hazard and facility information to the general public. <br /><br />Please visit Esri's ArcGIS for State Government Solution Site for additional information.<br/></p>
